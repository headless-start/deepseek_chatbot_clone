   - Users can chat in **English**, **Polish**, **German**, and **Hindi**.

2. **Language Translation**  
   - All user inputs and assistant responses are translated using **Google Translator** to ensure smooth interaction in the selected language.

3. **Chat History**  
   - Users can download the chat history as a `.txt` file for offline use.

4. **Interactive Chat Interface**  
   - The chatbot interface is built using **Streamlit**, allowing easy and intuitive interaction.
